KineSutra 
=============
*Motion capture + Haptic feedback*


This project combines a kinect-based motion capture system to model the movements of a choreographer. Then, the dance student dons a vibrational haptic suit and attempts to recapitulate those moves. If she deviates from the choreographed poses, the suit sends a message to her limbs via vibration, allowing her to correct her stance!


Technology
-----------
* Kinect / Asus XTion sensor
* Processing with SimpleOpenNI library
* Serial communication to Arduino via usb or bluetooth
* 20 vibration motors
